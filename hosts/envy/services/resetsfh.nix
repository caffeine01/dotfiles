# This is a workaround for an issue affecting how the AMD Sensor Fusion Hub
# on this HP Envy x360 is initialised and reinitialised during boot and wake
# from hibernate or suspend. The SFH works perfectly, but the amd_sfh kernel
# module needs to be reloaded each time in order it to be properly initialised.
# Most likely a hardware quirk, tried briefly to get a kernel patch made with an
# AMD rep on bugzilla but to no avail. Chasing this would take way too long 
# (i am a student after all) and so this will have to do for now.
